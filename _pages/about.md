Hi there, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at CU Boulder and am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/">Dr. Sriram Sankaranarayanan</a>, where we are part of the Programming Languages and Verification (<a href="https://plv.colorado.edu/">CUPLV</a>) lab.

My research interests are in the intersection of `Theoretical Machine Learning` and `Dynamical Systems`. I am generally fascinated about building models that can learn complex dynamical systems using machine learning or deep learning techniques. Currently, one of my main goals is to get models to learn physical systems governed by ODEs such as Damped Oscillator, Pendulum, Lotka-Volterra on a small scale, and then scale it up to more complex systems.

<!-- During my Master's thesis, I worked on developing a dataset, and benchmarking current SOTA models in salient object detection (SOD) especially for people who are visually impaired. Advised by <a href="https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG">Dr. Danna Gurari</a>.  -->

Prior to my masterâ€™s, I worked close to 4 years in the industry, where I developed products in the domain of algorithms, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. I recieved my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.rvce.edu.in/">RV College of Engineering, Bangalore</a>.

In my spare time, I love to bike (<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/141477766">Strava</a>) and watch football (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2ilw6e/what_with_it_in_arsenal_fans_saying_coyg/">#COYG</a>). I am originally from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bangalore-India">Bengaluru, Karnataka, India</a>, currently living in <a href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/">Boulder, Colorado, USA</a>.
