Hi there, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a second-year research based masterâ€™s student at the Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/">CU Boulder</a>.

My research interests span the areas of `Computer Vision and Deep Learning`. I am generally fascinated about learning representations of images and videos from limited labeled datasets that are useful and transferable across a wide range of domains. Specifically, I am interested in working on problems in domain adaptation, salient object detection, semantic segmentation and few shot learning. 

Currently, I am working at the <a href="https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/IVC_Group.html">Image and Video Computing Group</a> as a graduate research student under the supervision of <a href="https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/AboutMe.html">Dr. Danna Gurari</a>, with a focus in the area of `Salient Object Detection`.

Prior to my masterâ€™s, I worked close to 4 years in the industry, where I developed products in the domain of computer vision and reinforcement learning. I recieved my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.rvce.edu.in/">RV College of Engineering, Bangalore</a>.

In my spare time, I love to work on fun side projects, watch, play and analyse soccer! I am originally from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bangalore-India">Bengaluru, Karnataka, India</a>, currently living in <a href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/">Boulder, Colorado, USA</a>.
