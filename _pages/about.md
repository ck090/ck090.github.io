Hi there, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at CU Boulder advised by <a href="https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/">Dr. Sriram Sankaranarayanan</a> as part of the Programming Languages and Verification (<a href="https://plv.colorado.edu/">CUPLV</a>) lab.

My research interests are in the intersection of `Theoretical Machine Learning` and `Dynamical Systems`. I am generally fascinated about building models that can learn complex dynamical systems using machine learning or deep learning techniques. Currently, I am curious about modelling the behaviour of glucose (<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes/continuous-glucose-monitoring">CGM</a>) levels on a person with Type-1 diabetes in the presence of factors such as food consumption, and exercise.

During my Master's thesis, I worked on developing a dataset and benchmarking current SOTA models in salient object detection for people who are visually impaired, advised by <a href="https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG">Dr. Danna Gurari</a>. 

Prior to my masterâ€™s, I worked close to 4 years in the industry, where I developed products in the domain of computer vision and reinforcement learning. I recieved my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.rvce.edu.in/">RV College of Engineering, Bangalore</a>.

In my spare time, I love to work on fun side projects, hike, and play soccer! I am originally from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bangalore-India">Bengaluru, Karnataka, India</a>, currently living in <a href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/">Boulder, Colorado, USA</a>.
