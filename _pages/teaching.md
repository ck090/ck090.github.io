Below is a sample lecture notes from one my lectures as a Graduate Part-Time Instructor. In this lecture I continue with Quicksort and its modifications (introduced in the previous lecture) to undergraduates students. We end the lecture by working through a proof that shows Randomized Quicksort algorithm always leads to $$O(nlog_e n)$$ runtime, where $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$ is the size of the array/list

## YouTube 

In my free time I seek to create educational content on YouTube. Using <a href="https://www.manim.community/">Manim</a>, an animation engine developed by Grant Sanderson of <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3Blue1Brown</a>, I seek to make beautiful and clear visualizations of concepts in computer science especially on Data Structures and Algorithms.

I plan on creating more such content in the future.

## Principles of Programming Languages

Had the privilege of giving a guest lecture on *"Functors and Anonymous Functions in Scala"* for CSCI-3155: Principles of Programming Languages course at University of Colorado Boulder [Fall 2025]. 

*Content taken from my advisor's previous lecture on the same topic.*
